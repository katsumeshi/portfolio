description: "The app is also one of my own project.<br>The app is possible to know the photo detail such as exif data, geo tag. The one of features of app is possible to know where the photo tagged, and the geo tag of photo can delete and edit on the map.I came up with the idea of app since I am travel lover.  I want to know the exact place where I took.  Not only the geo tag detail, this app can prevent from stranger who tries to peep the information of place by function of deleting geo tag.<br><br> [Available on iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xie-zhenno-wei-zhi-qing-baono/id998243965?mt=8)."
