description: "The app is one of my own project.<br> This app is an English-Japanese dictionary,and  vice versa. When the word looks up, the image and pronunciation play at the same time. I made the app for Engish learners who are difficult to remember the words. The feature is the app makes effect their brain by the image and pronounciation related to words.<br><br> [Available on iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/naoni-ci-ji!-ying-he-he-ying/id1019032801?ls=1&mt=8)<br><br>"
